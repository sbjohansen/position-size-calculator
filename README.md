# Position Size and Profit Calculator

This is a Python application built using the tkinter library that allows users to calculate position sizes and potential losses based on their account balance, risk percentage, entry points, and stop-loss levels.

- Access source code and relevant links directly from the application.

2. Choose your desired entry type in the "Settings" section.
